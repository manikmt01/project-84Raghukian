                  <h2>Solutions for Partner Centric Proctoring</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The market's existing proctoring solutions frequently have serious drawbacks that might make it
                  challenging for
                  businesses to successfully employ them. The high cost of proctoring, which can make it challenging for
                  companies to
                  finance the necessary resources and technology, is one of the key problems. Furthermore, many of the
                  currently available
                  solutions do not have sufficient data security and compliance controls, which might expose businesses
                  to the risk of
                  data breaches or other security problems. Additionally, a lot of systems have limited branding
                  possibilities, which can
                  make it challenging for businesses to tailor their proctoring experience to suit their requirements
                  and branding.
                  Additionally, it might be challenging for businesses to adopt proctoring globally because many
                  solutions have a small
                  worldwide reach. We were motivated by these restrictions to develop a comprehensive, partner-centric
                  proctoring solution
                  that deals with these problems and offers organizations a more effective and efficient approach to
                  implement proctoring.</p>
